## Oliver Pople

I’m a former Advertising Strategist who has turned my ambitions towards Full Stack Development.

After graduating in Philosophy I joined Grey London where I planned campaigns viewed by 1billion+ people and won multiple industry awards for my strategic thinking. I now want to use my analytical mind and brand expertise to make things.
Specifically, I’m looking for a role where I can extend my programming knowledge, collaborate with some nice folks and make wicked consumer-facing products. 

## Skills

#### Empathy 

From paired programming to moderating focus groups I take pride in my ability to understand the needs of others.  Whilst working at Grey London I studied all kinds of people as I conducted consumer research. One such example was during a pitch for Sixt rent-a-car where I was responsible for all qualitative and quantitive data. By talking to consumers and challenging common preconceptions I uncovered a unique insight that helped us win the pitch and execute a very successful campaign soon after. Details of how I unearthed this insight are covered in my [award-winning APG paper](http://www.apg.org.uk/apgawards-2017) (in association with Google). This paper was mentioned in the Guardian Newspaper and has been published in the [APG 2017 Creative Strategy Awards](http://www.apg.org.uk/apg-bookstore) later this year.

#### Creative + Strategy

As someone whose regularly uses both sides of my brain, I’m comfortable merging creative flare with rational thinking.  One of my key roles at Grey London was to deliver emotionally relevant campaigns that hit the commercial objectives of big clients such as, Gillette and Symantec.  This role required me to have a deep understanding of traditionally “right-sided” subjects like culture and human psychologically, as well as “left-sided” subjects such as sales and media planning.  Some noteworthy campaigns include: [Gillette: The Honest Player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzX0Er9Lguk)
 and [Gillette: Shave Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6zlya7cG8Q&t=2s).
 
 #### Calm perseverance  
I’ve often been told by colleagues that I’m a ‘calming influence’.  This has been useful in advertising agencies where pitches and media deadlines often lead to late nights and tough conversations.  Fortunately, I don’t mind getting uncomfortable so long as there’s a worthy goal.  In fact, I regularly take ice baths and wake up early to be (consensually) strangled by other men during my morning Brazilian jiu-jitsu class. These things are unpleasant but (I like to think) they are worth it in the long term.
